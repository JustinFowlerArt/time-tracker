## My process

### Built with

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) - JS Superset
- [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/) - CSS Preprocessor

### What I learned

My goal for this project was a take a fairly straightforward design and use it to learn SASS. Since I had not worked with CSS preprocessors before, this was a great project to learn the basics and sprinkle in some more interesting design patterns like extend, mixins, and for loops. I also took this opportunity to learn and implement the BEM naming conventions to keep my scss organized.

### Useful resources

- [Understanding CSS BEM](https://codeburst.io/understanding-css-bem-naming-convention-a8cca116d252) - Includes practical guidance on how the BEM naming convention is structured, as well as how to use it in relation to SASS.
- [media query in scss](https://iqcode.com/code/css/media-query-in-scss) - Examples of ways to use media queries in SASS with mixins or variables.
- [Sass/SCSS for, each & while loops (Iteration Control) Tutorial](https://www.koderhq.com/tutorial/sass/iteration-control/#each) - Examples of how loops work in SASS and how to use them to map things like a font size variable to multiple h tags or more interestingly to map over colors based on nth child position.
